# Vol√©Py
---

Simple web interface to manage a RaspberryPi wifi connections through `nmcli`
and a chance to play with React. A couple `iptable` rules, and some `hostapd`
setup later and you're stealing wifi from your neighbors (not recommended).
Heavily commented for the learners out there :blush:.

## Installation

I pulled this project from an iso dump. I no longer run this myself, but
`pip install -r requirments.txt` should work.

## Running

Maybe `python -m volepy`??
